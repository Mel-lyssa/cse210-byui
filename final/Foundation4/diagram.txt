Class Diagram:
class Activity
{
    - Date: DateTime
    - Minutes: int

    + GetDistance(): double
    + GetSpeed(): double
    + GetPace(): double
    + GetSummary(): string
}

class Running : Activity
{
    - Distance: double

    + GetDistance(): double
    + GetSpeed(): double
    + GetPace(): double
}

class Cycling : Activity
{
    - Speed: double

    + GetDistance(): double
    + GetSpeed(): double
    + GetPace(): double
}

class Swimming : Activity
{
    - Laps: int

    + GetDistance(): double
    + GetSpeed(): double
    + GetPace(): double
}

Interaction:
- Running, Cycling, and Swimming inherit attributes and methods from the base Activity class.
- Each derived class overrides GetDistance(), GetSpeed(), and GetPace().
- GetSummary() produces a summary string for each activity.
Description:
    The base class Activity defines shared attributes and virtual methods for distance, speed, pace, and summary.
    Derived classes (Running, Cycling, Swimming) inherit from Activity and provide specific implementations of these methods.
    Users can create different activity instances, calculate activity-specific metrics, and generate activity summaries.
