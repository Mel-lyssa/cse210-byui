Interaction:

- GetStandardDetails(), GetFullDetails(), and GetShortDescription() produce marketing messages.
Description:
    The base class Event represents common event attributes, such as title, description, date, time, and address.
    Derived classes (Lecture, Reception, OutdoorGathering) inherit from Event and add specific attributes.
    The Address class holds address information used in events.
    Users can create different types of events and obtain marketing messages with varying details based on the event type.
